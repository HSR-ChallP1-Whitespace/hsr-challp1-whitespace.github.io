Today we have learnt a lot of things, and we opened our minds to new ideas.
After the conversation with the math professor, it seemed clear for us, that the first thing we need is a good data visualization. If we can represent the data as a nice function graph, it will be easier to recognize possible patterns. Also we will be able to see how can we know if we passed the lap.

Here a nice image of our first graph!!
